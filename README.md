## Project Overview
In this analysis, I created a Tableaus dashboard to help clients better understand the demographics of their ride share program's customer base, The dashboard allows users to see how gender identity relates to customer type, ride frequency, and ride length. 

## Results

Focusing in on customer demographics reveals that the majority of business is coming from Male Subscribers.

Across all demographics, the most popular ride times tend to be:
- weekdays during typical commuting hours (7-9am and 5-7pm)
- Saturdays during daylight hours (10am - 5pm)

Finally, focusing in on trip duration reveals that the vast majority of trips last less than 30 minutes.
- The most common trip time for males was 5 minutes (108,087 trips). 
-  The most common trip time for females was 6 minutes (34,151 trips).

## Summary

This analysis reveals that male commuters and Saturday tourists tend to be the most frequent users of this service. 

In the future, if my client wanted to focus on growing the female user population, I would recommend my client to begin offering promotional discounts to women who sign up for the service as well as varying bike sizes. This could lead to some interesting future analyses, such as a study of most popular bike sizes among by gender or increase in ride length when a promotional discount was used.
